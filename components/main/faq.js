If yes, the program is for you. \n Students right from the 8th grade to college students to working professionals, anyone can join the program as long as they are open to exploring one career option every week. If you are already in a field and you want to shift to a closely associated field,  we might not be a good fit for you. Let's say you are a software engineer and you want to become a product manager, you'll be much better suited to explore product management yourself. If you are open to exploring a diverse set of career options, we can definitely help",

We understand that this is a new concept and you might need some time check if this is really useful for you. If you are not able to afford to pay â‚¹1000, you can choose to pay any amount you are comfortable with. You'll be able to explore 15 career options within this. The price is for the entire program. There are no packages. No extra charges will be charged per career option.",
